/**
 * This interface describes a highly simplified insulin dose calculator.
 * <p>
 * Patients with type-2 diabetes need periodic insulin injections to help
 * process blood sugar. It is critical to be able to provide enough insulin to
 * metabolize the carbohydrates obtained from food, and even more critical to
 * never inject higher doses that may cause hypoglycemia, potentially leading to
 * coma and brain damage.
 * <p>
 * One of the fundamental goals is to maintain a target blood sugar level
 * throughout the day, somewhere between 80 mg/dl and 120 mg/dl (constant for a
 * given patient, as prescribed by the doctor). Patients regularly measure the
 * blood glucose level and calculate the necessary insulin.
 * <p>
 * Classes implementing this interface should use floating point arithmetic
 * internally for all calculations, with results rounded to the nearest integer.

	 * Calculates the number of insulin units needed after one meal.
	 * <p>
	 * This method takes the amount of carbohydrate in a given meal, and returns
	 * the number of units of insulin needed after that meal. The returned
	 * number of units of insulin equals the carbohydrate dose plus the high
	 * blood sugar dose, which are computed as follows.
	 * <p>
	 * The carbohydrate dose equals the total grams of carbohydrates in the meal
	 * divided by the amount of carbohydrate disposed by one unit of insulin,
	 * corrected by taking into account the personal sensitivity to insulin.
	 * This dose equals <code>carbohydrateAmount / carbohydrateToInsulinRatio /
	 * personalSensitivity x 50</code>.
	 * <p>
	 * The high blood sugar dose equals the difference between the pre-meal
	 * blood sugar level and the target blood sugar level, divided by the
	 * personal sensitivity to insulin. This equals <code>(preMealBloodSugar -
	 * targetBloodSugar) / personalSensitivity</code>. The personal sensitivity
	 * may be estimated using <code>personalSensitivityToInsulin()</code>.
	 * <p>
	 * In the special case when the target blood sugar level is greater than the
	 * pre-meal blood sugar level, the return value of this method is zero (no
	 * insulin).

	/**
	 * Determines an individual's sensitivity to one unit of insulin.
	 * <p>
	 * One unit of insulin typically drops blood sugar by 50 mg/dl, but this
	 * value depends on each individual's sensitivity and daily physical
	 * activity. This method predicts the blood sugar drop (in mg/dl) that will
	 * result from one unit of insulin, for a given physical activity level.
	 * <p>
	 * To predict the blood sugar drop, this method accepts two arrays with
	 * K samples of (physical activity level, blood sugar drop). The two arrays
	 * must therefore have the same length. First, a simple linear regression
	 * (least squares method) is performed to compute alpha and beta. Then, the
	 * return value is <code>alpha + beta x physicalActivityLevel</code>.
	 * <p>
	 * The physical activity levels, including the ones in the array of samples,
	 * and the blood sugar drop values are non-negative integers. The return
	 * value of this method may be passed to <code>mealtimeInsulinDose()</code>
	 * as a parameter.
	 * 
	 * @param physicalActivityLevel most recent activity level (the predictor)
	 * @param physicalActivitySamples K samples of past physical activity
	 * @param bloodSugarDropSamples corresponding K samples of blood sugar drop
	 * @return the blood sugar drop in mg/dl, or -1 in case of error
